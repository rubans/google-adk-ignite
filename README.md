# google-adk-ignite

This project outlines a **multi-agent architecture** designed to extract market intelligence from PDF documents and produce insightful market reports using both human-in-the-loop input and advanced AI tools.

> **Note:** This system is built using the latest **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**, enabling robust agent orchestration, communication, and tool integration.

## ðŸ“Š Overview

The system is composed of five distinct agents, each responsible for a specific step in the pipeline. The flow is designed to be **modular, parallelizable**, and optionally extensible with agent-to-agent orchestration (A2A).

### âœ… Agents and Responsibilities

- **Agent ParseBot**  
  Parses PDF documents to extract structured entity data.

- **Agent Clarifier**  
  Presents the extracted entities for **human input/verification**.

- **Agent PriceProbe**  
  Uses the **Yahoo Tool** with **MCP (Market Clearing Price)** logic to fetch current market prices.

- **Agent DataSage**  
  Leverages **Gemini LLM** to generate product market reports from **historical data**.

- **Agent InsightX**  
  Consolidates information from other agents to generate a **final market report**.

## ðŸ§° Technology Stack

- **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** â€“ Core framework for defining and managing agents  
- **Gemini LLM** â€“ For historical data analysis and report generation  
- **Yahoo Finance APIs** â€“ For real-time market pricing  

## ðŸ”€ Flow Diagram

The system follows a partially parallel workflow:
